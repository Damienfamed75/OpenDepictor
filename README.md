# Open Depictor
###### *Open Source Depiction Application in OpenGL 3.X+*

A visual engine for Idol Scheme.
The goal is the make OpenGL as object oriented as possible to make it easy to create new objects and move the around.
This should speed up the process of making anything using OpenGL.
This can be included in projects for OpenGL use as well.

Things like making a basic polygon should be as easy as:
```cpp
RegularPolygon *myPolygon = new RegularPolygon(x, y, z, radius, numOfSides);
```

Still under construction though  :)
